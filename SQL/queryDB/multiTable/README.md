Create table of user and post to answer the following queries: 
!(usersAndpostsTable.png)

Queries to get:

    ![](first10Tweets.png)


    Use JOIN to get user's info along with their tweets:
    ![](userInfoTweets.png)

    * This is displayed by making a TIMESTAMP field under the posts column.

![](AddBios.png)
